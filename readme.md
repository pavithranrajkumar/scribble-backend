# Scribble

Hey! 👋 This is my blog app called Scribble. I built it using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Here's how to get it running.

## Quick Start 🚀

### Backend Setup

# Go to server folder

```
cd server
```

# Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

# Populate environment file

Provide your own values in .env file

# Add some test data

```
npm run seed
```

# Start the server

```
npm run dev
```

## What I Used 🛠

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- TailwindCSS for making it pretty
- React Router for pages
- React Hook Form for forms
- Zod for making sure data is valid

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- Apollo Server for GraphQL
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- TypeScript
- JWT for keeping users logged in

## Cool Features ✨

- Login and signup
- Create, edit, and delete posts
- Like/dislike system
- View all posts or just your own
- Works on phones too!

## Test Account 🔑

Want to try it out? Use these:

- Email: pavithran@example.com
- Password: password123

## Important URLs 🌐

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Notes 📝

- Make sure MongoDB is running
- Backend needs to be running for frontend to work
- Check the .env files in both folders
- The seed command adds some test posts and users

## Common Issues 🔧

- If backend won't start, check MongoDB connection
- If login fails, try running the seed command first

That's it! Let me know if something's not working! 😊
